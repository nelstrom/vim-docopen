INTRODUCTION                                    *docopen*

This plugin lets you quickly jump from Vim's built-in documentation to the
online help in the browser. For example, run:

    :help
    :DocOpen

From Vim, your browser should open with the URL for the online help:

    http://vimhelp.appspot.com/help.txt.html

If you're running NeoVim, you should instead see this URL:

    https://neovim.io/doc/user/help.html

If the cursor is positioned on a helptag, then the generated URL will include
an anchor with that helptag (URL encoded). For example, running these commands
will open your Browser with the following URLs:

    :help j
    :DocOpen
    Vim: http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#j
    NeoVim: https://neovim.io/doc/user/motion.html#j

    :help {offset}
    :DocOpen
    Vim: http://vimhelp.appspot.com/pattern.txt.html#%7Boffset%7D
    NeoVim: https://neovim.io/doc/user/pattern.html#%7Boffset%7D

The following commands and mappings are provided only in buffers where the
